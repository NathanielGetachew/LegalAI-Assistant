    "### Task Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to classify legal complaint text into predefined violation categories (multi-class classification) using two approaches:\n",
    "- Fine-tuning a smaller language model\n",
    "- Prompt engineering using the base model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Labels (examples from LegalLens):\n",
    "- Harassment\n",
    "- Wage Theft\n",
    "- Discrimination\n",
    "- Unsafe Work Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is suitable for comparing both approaches because:\n",
    "- It requires understanding of context and semantics.\n",
    "- The dataset is rich with labeled examples.\n",
    "- The use case mirrors real-world legal classification needs.\n"
